Like other Cosmos-based chains, validators on the Router chain are expected to mine blocks in exchange for block rewards. However, validators on the Router chain are tasked with another responsibility - running an orchestrator instance. Before reading more about orchestrators, it is important to understand the high-level workflow of a cross-chain transaction via Router.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"running-a-validator/on-devnet/configure-and-run-an-orchestrator-instance":{"id":"running-a-validator/on-devnet/configure-and-run-an-orchestrator-instance","title":"Step 3) Configure and Run an Orchestrator Instance","description":"Before proceeding with this step, make sure that you are running a validator.
