:::note
You can find the API swagger **[here](../../../api/?v=ROUTER-PAY)**
:::

Any dApp can integrate Router Pay to provide it's users a no sign-up UX. This can be easily done by integrating Router Pay APIs. 
Integration of Router Pay is a 2 step process -
1. **Generation of deposit address:** API to generate a deposit address where user will send their funds to. Relayer will use the funds sent to this address to execute the transaction on behalf of the user.
2. **Check status:** API to check the status of the transaction.
