description: A simple ping pong contract using Router Gatway contracts
---

In this section we will go through how a simple cross-chain ping-pong dApp can be created by integrating the Router Gateway contracts directly.

### Installing the dependencies
Install the evm-gateway contracts with the following command:
`yarn add evm-gateway-contract`  or  `npm install evm-gateway-contract`

### Instantiating the contract
``` javascript
pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

import "evm-gateway-contract/contracts/IGateway.sol";
import "evm-gateway-contract/contracts/ICrossTalkApplication.sol";
import "evm-gateway-contract/contracts/Utils.sol";

contract PingPong is ICrossTalkApplication {
}
```
1. Import the IGateway.sol, ICrossTalkApplication.sol and Utils.sol from `evm-gateway-contract/contracts`.
2. Inherit the ICrossTalkApplication contract into your main contract (PingPong).

### Creating state variables and the constructor
``` javascript
IGateway public gatewayContract;
string public greeting;
uint64 public lastEventIdentifier;
uint64 public destGasLimit;
uint64 public ackGasLimit;

error CustomError(string message);

constructor(
	address payable gatewayAddress, 
	uint64 _destGasLimit, 
	uint64 _ackGasLimit
) {
  gatewayContract = IGateway(gatewayAddress);
	destGasLimit = _destGasLimit;
	ackGasLimit = _ackGasLimit;
}
```
1. Create an instance to the **gateway** contract of type IGateway. This will be the contract which will route your message to the Router Chain.
2. Create a variable **greeting** of type string which we will be setting on the destination chain when the ping is received.  
3. Create a variable **lastEventIdentifier** of type uint64 which is the nonce for cross-chain transaction generated by the Gateway contract. This will be used to verify the nonce when the acknowledgement comes from back to the source chain from the destination chain.
4. Create a variable **destGasLimit** of type uint256 which indicates the amount of gas required to execute the function that will handle our cross-chain request on the destination chain. This can be easily calculated using any gas estimator. You can use [*hardhat-gas-reporter*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter) plugin to calculate this. 
5. Create a variable **ackGasLimit** of type uint256 which indicates the amount of gas required to execute the callback function that will handle the acknowledgement coming back from to the source chain. This can be easily calculated using any gas estimator.
6. Create a custom error variable which can be used to throw custom errors.
7. Create an event **ExecutionStatus** with parameters uint64 eventIdentifier and a bool isSuccess. We will use it to emit event when we handle the acknowledgement coming back to the source chain from the destination chain.
8. Create an event **ReceivedSrcChainIdAndType** with parameters uint64 chainType and string chainID. We will use it to emit event when we handle the acknowledgement coming back to the source chain from the destination chain.
9. Create the constructor with the address of gateway contract, the destination gas limit and the ack gas limit and set these variables inside the constructor.

### Sending a ping to the destination chain
``` javascript
function pingDestination(
  uint64 chainType,
  string memory chainId,
  uint64 destGasPrice,
  uint64 ackGasPrice,
  address destinationContractAddress,
  string memory str,
  uint64 expiryDurationInSeconds
) public payable returns (uint64) {
  bytes memory payload = abi.encode(str);
  uint64 expiryTimestamp = uint64(block.timestamp) + expiryDurationInSeconds;
  bytes[] memory addresses = new bytes[](1);
  addresses[0] = toBytes(destinationContractAddress);
  bytes[] memory payloads = new bytes[](1);
  payloads[0] = payload;
  _pingDestination(
    expiryTimestamp,
    destGasPrice,
    ackGasPrice,
    chainType,
    chainId,
    payloads,
    addresses
  );
}

function _pingDestination(
  uint64 expiryTimestamp,
  uint64 destGasPrice,
  uint64 ackGasPrice,
  uint64 chainType,
  string memory chainId,
  bytes[] memory payloads,
  bytes[] memory addresses
) internal {
  lastEventIdentifier = gatewayContract.requestToDest(
    expiryTimestamp,
    false,
    Utils.AckType.ACK_ON_SUCCESS,
    Utils.AckGasParams(ackGasLimit, ackGasPrice),
    Utils.DestinationChainParams(
      destGasLimit,
      destGasPrice,
      chainType,
      chainId
    ),
    Utils.ContractCalls(payloads, addresses)
  );
}
```
1. Create a function with whatever name you want to call it. Here, we will call it the pingDestination function which accepts seven parameters: 
    1. **chainType:** Type of the destination chain. The values for chain types can be found [here](../../understanding-crosstalk/chainTypes).
    2. **chainId:** Chain ID of the destination chain in string format.
    3. **destGasPrice:** Gas price of the destination chain.
    4. **ackGasPrice:** Gas price of the source chain.
        
        To get the gas price for a chain, you can use the following function:
        
        ```jsx
        // using ethers.js
        const gasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();

        // using web3.js
        const gasPrice = web3.eth.getGasPrice().then((result) => {
	        console.log(web3.utils.fromWei(result, 'ether'))
        })
        ```
        
    5. **destinationContractAddress:** Address of the contract that will handle the payload on the destination chain. Basically the address on the destination chain which we are going to ping.
    6. **str:** This is just the string that we want to send as payload to the destination contract. You can send any kind of data as per your requirements.
    7. **expiryDurationInSeconds:** The duration in seconds for which the cross-chain request created after calling this function remains valid. If the expiry duration elapses before the request is executed on the destination chain contract, the request will fail. If you don’t want to keep any expiry timestamp, just send a very large number (a trillion will do) and your request will never expire.
2. **Create the payload:** Here, we only want to send a ping with a message. That is why we will just abi encode the string we want to send and set it as the payload. However, you are not limited to just sending a string, you can send any kind of data you want. Just abi encode those data and set it as payload.
3. **Calculating the expiry timestamp:** As you must have already guessed, the expiry timestamp will be the <code>block.timestamp + expiryDurationInSeconds</code>.
4. **Creating the array of destination contract addresses:** With each cross-chain request, you can send multiple payloads to multiple destination chain contracts. The addresses to the recipient contracts on the destination chains need to be encoded into bytes format and sent as an array. To encode the address into bytes, you can use the function specified [here](../../understanding-crosstalk/requestToDest#6-contractcalls).
    
    Since here we are only sending one payload and to just one contract on the destination chain, we will create a bytes array named **addresses** of just one element and add the bytes encoded destination contract address to the array.
    
5. **Creating the array of payload:** As in case with the array of destination contract addresses, since we only have one payload, we will create a bytes array named **payloads** of just one element and add the payload we created to this array.
6. **Calling the gateway contract to generate a cross-chain communication request:** Now the time has come for us to generate a cross-chain communication request to the destination chain. Now we will call the <code>_pingDestination</code> function with the required parameters which in turn will call the <code>requestToDest</code> function of the Gateway contract. The documentation for this function can be found [here](../../understanding-crosstalk/requestToDest).
    
    This function returns the nonce of the cross-chain requests generated by the Gateway contract. We will store this nonce into the lastEventIdentifier variable. Now, we have successfully generated a cross-chain request to ping the destination chain contract. 

### Handling a cross-chain request

Now since we know how we can create a cross-chain communication request from the source chain, we will now handle that request on the destination chain. We will be deploying the same contract on both the source and the destination chains, so we need to create the functionality to handle the cross-chain communication request here. 

```javascript
function handleRequestFromSource(
  bytes memory srcContractAddress,
  bytes memory payload,
  string memory srcChainId,
  uint64 srcChainType
) external override returns (bytes memory) {
  require(msg.sender == address(gatewayContract));

  string memory sampleStr = abi.decode(payload, (string));

  if (
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sampleStr)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(""))
  ) {
    revert CustomError("String should not be empty");
  }
  greeting = sampleStr;
  return abi.encode(srcChainId, srcChainType);
}
```

1. Create a function named **handleRequestFromSource** and here, the name matters. The function signature, i.e. the name and the parameters it receive has to be the same since this function is called by the Gateway contract on the destination chain and if the name or the parameters to this function changes, the call will fail. The details about the parameters to this function is explained [here](../../understanding-crosstalk/handleRequestFromSource) in detail.
2. First, we will check that the request can only be sent by the Gateway contract. No other contract or wallet should be able to call this function. We should also check that the request is received from our contract only from the source chain but for simplicity I have not added that condition. You can add it simply by mapping the contract addresses by their chain type and chain ID and checking that the <code>srcContractAddress</code> is equal to the address stored in the map for source chain type and chain ID. We are leaving this as an exercise for you.
3. Since the request was generated by us, we know exactly what is received inside the payload. Since we sent just a string, we will decode it and store it in a <code>sampleStr</code> string variable.
4. If the string sent from the source chain is empty, we throw a custom error and this will trigger an error acknowledgement to the Router Chain. 
5. We will now set the greeting as <code>sampleStr</code> if the sampleStr string is non-empty and return the abi encoded chain ID received with the function. This will trigger a success acknowledgement to the Router Chain.

Now we have handled the request on the destination chain. Now we would like to handle the acknowledgement too on the source chain so that we are able to do some operations based on the acknowledgement we receive.

### Handling the acknowledgement received from destination chain

When the cross-chain request is executed on the destination chain, the destination chain contract triggers an acknowledgement to the source chain. Since we opted to handle the acknowledgement on success when we triggered a cross-chain request, we will have to create a function to handle the acknowledgement.

```javascript
function handleCrossTalkAck(
    uint64 eventIdentifier,
    bool[] memory execFlags,
    bytes[] memory execData
  ) external view override {
    require(lastEventIdentifier == eventIdentifier);
		
    bytes memory _execData = abi.decode(execData[0], (bytes));

    (string memory chainID, uint64 chainType) = abi.decode(
      _execData,
      (string, uint64)
    );
		
		// emits the event identifier and true as execFlags[0]
    emit ExecutionStatus(eventIdentifier, execFlags[0]);
		// emits the source chain Id and type that it gets back from the dest chain
    emit ReceivedSrcChainIdAndType(chainType, chainID);
  }
```

1. Create a function named **handleCrossTalkAck** and here, the name matters. The function signature, i.e. the name and the parameters it receive has to be the same since this function is called by the Gateway contract on the destination chain and if the name or the parameters to this function changes, the call will fail. The details about the parameters to this function is explained [here](../../understanding-crosstalk/handleCrossTalkAck) in detail.
2. In the **eventIdentifier,** we receive the nonce which was returned from the **requestToDest** function of the Gateway contract when the request originated from source chain.
3. Since we sent only one call, 
    1. **if the execution was successful on the destination chain:**
        
        We will get <code>[true]</code> in execFlags and <code>[abi.encode(abi.encode(sourceChainType, sourceChainId))]</code> in execData as we sent this as return value in handleRequestFromSource function.
        
    2. **If the execution failed on the destination chain:**
        
        We will get <code>[false]</code> in execFlags and <code>[abi.encode(errorBytes)]</code> in execData where error bytes correspond to the error that was thrown on the destination chain contract.
        
    
    Since we sent <code>abi.encode(srcChainId, srcChainType)</code> as return values from the destination chain’s **handleRequestFromSource** function, we can decode it here in the **handleCrossTalkAck** function. First we decode the execData[0] where the return value has come in. We decode it as bytes first. And then decode it into the chainID and chainType of the respective types. In this way, you can get the data back from the source chain.
    
In this way, we can create a simple ping pong smart contract using the Router CrossTalk.
