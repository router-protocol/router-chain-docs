description: Some benefits of stateful bridging
---


Router's stateful bridging (OmniChain) framework is a subset of Router's CrossTalk framework that leverages Router chain's architectural components to allow for the creation of seamless cross-chain applications with custom bridging logic. Some of the benefits of stateful bridging:

- By allowing developers to program their complex logic on just one smart contract on the Router chain, Router's stateful bridging can help reduce code redundancy and save developers' time and effort. 
- With complete control over their application's bridging logic, developers can define the encoding and decoding of dApp data as they see fit, and perform any operation on the data. 
- With middleware contracts (smart contracts on the Router chain), developers can optimize their costs by converting multiple incoming requests to Router chain into a single outgoing request to a destination chain.
- Also, while creating outgoing requests to other chains, the middleware contract can configure the payload in such a way that multiple requests can be generated for different destination chains.
